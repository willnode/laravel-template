# Laravel Template + Daisy UI

+ Laravel Jetstream
+ Vue.js + Inertia
+ Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI

This template is based on opinions that I like

+ Laravel Jetstream handles Auth and Team management, only focus on your app business logic.
+ Vue.js + Inertia avoids full page reloads and delivers minimum overhead to the backend while syntax changes is keep minimum compared to React or Svelte.
+ DaisyUI avoids writing custom components. You just need to follow official documentation to implement things!

The Jetstream to DaisyUI component conversion is WIP.
